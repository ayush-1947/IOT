# 5G Network Slicing Optimization Framework

## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive framework for optimizing resource allocation in 5G networks through dynamic network slicing. By leveraging advanced simulation techniques, the framework enables efficient allocation of network resources across multiple virtual network slices, each designed to serve different types of applications with varying Quality of Service (QoS) requirements.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Network Slicing**: Create and manage multiple virtual networks over shared physical infrastructure.
- **Slice-Specific Optimization**: Tailored resource allocation strategies for URLLC, IoT, and Data slices.
- **Latency-Aware Resource Allocation**: Prioritizes traffic based on sensitivity to delay.
- **Intelligent Base Station Selection**: Load-aware assignment to prevent congestion.
- **Adaptive Resource Reservation**: Dynamically adjusts reserved capacity based on performance metrics.
- **Real-Time Performance Monitoring**: Comprehensive tracking of latency, bandwidth usage, and SLA violations.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Rich dashboard showing network topology and performance metrics.

## Core Algorithms



### Dynamic Resource Allocation

The framework implements a priority-based resource allocation algorithm that:

- Groups clients by their assigned slices.
- For each base station and slice, applies slice-specific allocation strategies.
- Prioritizes clients based on waiting time, QoS class, and slice type.
- Ensures minimum guaranteed bandwidth before distributing remaining resources.


def dynamic_resource_allocation(env, slices, clients):
    while True:
        # Group clients by slice
        clients_by_slice = {}
        for client in clients:
            if client.base_station is None or not client.connected:
                continue
                
            slice_obj = client.get_slice()
            if slice_obj:
                slice_name = slice_obj.name
                if slice_name not in clients_by_slice:
                    clients_by_slice[slice_name] = []
                clients_by_slice[slice_name].append(client)
        
        # Apply dynamic allocation for each slice
        for base_station in base_stations:
            for slice_obj in base_station.slices:
                if hasattr(slice_obj, 'dynamic_resource_allocation'):
                    slice_clients = clients_by_slice.get(slice_obj.name, [])
                    bs_clients = [c for c in slice_clients if c.base_station == base_station]
                    if bs_clients:
                        slice_obj.dynamic_resource_allocation(bs_clients)
        
        yield env.timeout(0.5)


### Intelligent Base Station Selection

The framework uses a load-aware base station selection algorithm that considers both distance and current load:

def assign_closest_base_station(self, exclude=None):
    updated_list = []
    for d, b in self.closest_base_stations:
        if exclude is not None and b.pk in exclude:
            continue
        d = distance((self.x, self.y), (b.coverage.center[0], b.coverage.center[1]))
        
        # Calculate load as percentage of capacity used
        slice_load = 0
        if hasattr(b, 'slices') and len(b.slices) > self.subscribed_slice_index:
            target_slice = b.slices[self.subscribed_slice_index]
            if hasattr(target_slice, 'capacity') and hasattr(target_slice.capacity, 'level'):
                slice_load = 1 - (target_slice.capacity.level / target_slice.capacity.capacity)
        
        # Weighted score: distance + load factor
        score = d * (1 + slice_load)
        updated_list.append((score, d, b))
        
    # Sort by the combined score
    updated_list.sort(key=operator.itemgetter(0))
    
    for score, d, b in updated_list:
        if d <= b.coverage.radius:
            self.base_station = b
            return


### Adaptive Resource Reservation
The framework dynamically adjusts reserved capacity based on recent latency trends:

def _adapt_reserved_capacity(self):
    if not self.latency_history or len(self.latency_history) < 5:
        return
        
    # Get recent trend
    recent = self.latency_history[-5:]
    recent_avg = sum(recent) / len(recent)
    
    # If recent latency is higher than overall average, increase reservation
    if recent_avg > self.avg_latency and recent_avg > (0.8 * self.delay_tolerance):
        new_reserve = min(self.init_capacity * 0.1, 
                          self.reserved_capacity + (self.init_capacity * 0.02))
        self.reserved_capacity = new_reserve
    # If recent latency is lower, we can reduce reservation
    elif recent_avg < self.avg_latency and recent_avg < (0.5 * self.delay_tolerance):
        self.reserved_capacity = max(0, 
                                   self.reserved_capacity - (self.init_capacity * 0.01))


### Optimization Results
